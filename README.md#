# Express Route Demo Application

A simple **Node.js + Express** application demonstrating modular route handling.  
The app serves different endpoints for `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, and `/date`.

---

## Overview

This project showcases a clean and modular approach to handling routes in an Express server.  
Each route is separated into its own file within the `routes/` directory, making the application easy to maintain and extend.

### Available Routes

| Route       | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| `/`          | Home route                         |
| `/about`     | About page                         |
| `/contact`   | Contact information route           |
| `/date`      | Displays the current date and time  |

##  Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution.  
- **Express.js** - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.  
- **npm** - Node package manager used to install project dependencies.
